# DataStructreApp

## Project Description
I created this project to teach beginners how to use Linked List, Queue, and Binary Tree <in some simple programs. The aim of this project is to make it easier for them to understand the basic concepts of these data structures and to demonstrate how to use them in programming.

Additionally, I have provided comments throughout the code to explain each step of the process. This will help beginners follow along more easily and understand how the code works.

Moreover, I have implemented CRUD operations in the project, which will enable beginners to learn how to create, read, update, and delete data from these data structures.

By following this project, beginners can learn how to use these data structures and their applications in programming in a better way.
